# Bootstrap

One-shot ceremony per network. Takes the protocol from compiled code to live,
immutable on-chain state.

After bootstrap finishes:

- `mix_box`, `mix_logic`, and `fee_contract` are published as CIP-33 reference
  scripts so future Mix txs cite them via `--tx-in-reference` instead of
  inlining ~5 KiB of script per tx.
- The `mix_logic` stake credential is registered (so withdraw-zero spends are
  valid going forward).
- A one-of-one **reference NFT** lives forever at the always-False
  `reference_holder` script address, with an inline `ProtocolParams` datum.
- 10 fee-contract shards are seeded at `fee_contract`.
- `artifacts/<network>/addresses.json` holds the canonical address book — it
  gets committed to git after a clean run.

## Stages

Four stages, one operator command each. Stage 1 internally chains four txs.

| # | script | what it does | tx count |
|---|--------|--------------|---------:|
| 0 | `00-build-reference.sh`           | offline. Parameterizes the validators in dependency order (`one_shot_mint(seed) → mix_logic(NFT) → mix_box(mix_logic) → fee_contract(NFT)`), writes resolved hashes to `addresses.json`. | 0 |
| 1 | `01-publish-and-register.sh`      | recursive tx chain: publishes `mix_box`, `mix_logic`, `fee_contract` as CIP-33 reference scripts (one tx per script — keeps every tx well under the 16 KiB limit as validators grow), then registers the `mix_logic` stake credential, attaching the script via `--certificate-tx-in-reference` against tx 2's output. Each tx after the first spends the previous tx's change output as funding, so the operator only supplies one funding UTxO + one collateral UTxO. | 4 |
| 2 | `02-mint-and-lock.sh`             | **irreversible.** Spends `SEED_UTXO`, mints the one-of-one NFT, locks at `reference_holder` with the inline `ProtocolParams` datum. | 1 |
| 3 | `03-fund-fee-contract.sh`         | seeds 10 shards at `fee_contract`. | 1 |

The single-script-per-tx convention inside stage 1 isolates failures (a publish
that fails costs only its own funding + fee, not the whole infrastructure
setup) and matches the recursive ref-input pattern the production txs will
use.

## Wallet

One keypair, multiple per-network address files. A Cardano signing key carries
no network identity — the same keypair works across preprod / preview /
mainnet; only the bech32 address encoding differs.

`init-wallet.sh` sets it up. Idempotent — re-running with an existing keypair
or address leaves it alone, so it's safe to run any time you add a new
network or want to make sure the wallet exists.

```sh
./infra/bootstrap/init-wallet.sh                  # preprod + preview
./infra/bootstrap/init-wallet.sh --include-mainnet # also mainnet (opt-in)
```

Layout (everything under `infra/bootstrap/wallets/`, all gitignored):

```
infra/bootstrap/wallets/
├── payment.skey               # shared signing key (NEVER commit)
├── payment.vkey               # shared verification key
├── payment.preprod.addr       # bech32 address for preprod
├── payment.preview.addr       # bech32 address for preview
└── payment.mainnet.addr       # only if --include-mainnet
```

Fund `payment.preprod.addr` from the [Preprod faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet/).

Budget for a clean Preprod bootstrap (defaults assumed):

| stage | what                               | ≈ ADA |
|-------|------------------------------------|------:|
| 1     | three ref-script outputs + cert    | 80    |
| 2     | reference UTxO @ reference_holder  | 5     |
| 3     | 10 fee shards × `max_fee × 5`      | 40    |
|       | per-tx fees + collateral float     | 10    |
| **total** |                                | **≈ 135** |

Round up to ~150 ADA so you don't have to top up mid-bootstrap.

## Running it

```sh
# One-time wallet setup (idempotent — re-runs are no-ops once the keypair exists).
./infra/bootstrap/init-wallet.sh

export NETWORK=preprod
export TESTNET_MAGIC=1
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=/path/to/preprod-node.socket
export BOOTSTRAP_ADDR=$(cat infra/bootstrap/wallets/payment.preprod.addr)
export PAYMENT_SKEY=infra/bootstrap/wallets/payment.skey

# Stage 0 — offline. Pick a SEED_UTXO from the wallet first; it'll be consumed
# by 02-mint-and-lock.
./contracts/build.sh config/network.preprod.json
SEED_UTXO=<txid>#<idx>           # an unspent UTxO at BOOTSTRAP_ADDR
NETWORK=$NETWORK SEED_UTXO=$SEED_UTXO ./infra/bootstrap/00-build-reference.sh

# Stage 1 — chains 4 txs (publish mix_box, mix_logic, fee_contract; register
# mix_logic). Operator provides one FUNDING_UTXO and one COLLATERAL_UTXO.
FUNDING_UTXO=<txid>#<idx> COLLATERAL_UTXO=<txid>#<idx> \
  ./infra/bootstrap/01-publish-and-register.sh

# Wait for stage 1 to confirm before continuing — addresses.json now has
# referenceScriptUtxos populated.

# Stage 2 — IRREVERSIBLE. Spends SEED_UTXO from stage 0; collateral separate.
SEED_UTXO=$SEED_UTXO COLLATERAL_UTXO=<txid>#<idx> \
  ./infra/bootstrap/02-mint-and-lock.sh
# wait for confirmation

# Stage 3 — seed 10 fee shards.
FUNDING_UTXO=<txid>#<idx> ./infra/bootstrap/03-fund-fee-contract.sh
```

Then commit:

```sh
git add artifacts/preprod/addresses.json
git commit -m "bootstrap(preprod): mint NFT <policy>, ref UTxO <txid>#<idx>"
```

### How the chain in stage 1 works

The script uses `cardano-cli conway transaction txid --tx-file <signed-tx>`
to derive each tx's id offline (no node call), then references that id as the
input of the next tx. Submission is sequential — `cardano-cli conway
transaction build` resolves the next input against the local node's UTxO set
+ mempool, so each tx must already be in flight before the next one builds.
On Preprod that means stage 1 takes one block window (~20 s) end to end; on a
slower node you may see "input not found" errors and need to add `sleep 5`
between submissions.

## What can go wrong

- **Seed UTxO consumed by the wrong tx.** The `one_shot_mint(seed)` policy
  fires only if `seed` is in the inputs of the mint tx. If 02 fails for any
  reason and the seed got spent in a different tx, you have to start over
  with a different seed. Re-run `00-build-reference.sh` with the new seed
  before retrying.
- **Inline-datum decode error at the reference UTxO.** Validators that read
  `ProtocolParams` will hard-fail if the datum doesn't decode. After 02
  confirms, sanity-check the inline datum (`cardano-cli query utxo`
  `--address <reference_holder_addr> --output-json`).
- **Stage 1 chain breaks mid-flight.** If tx 2 or 3 of stage 1 fails to
  confirm, re-run only the tail. The simplest recovery is to re-run stage 1
  with a fresh `FUNDING_UTXO` — the already-published ref scripts from the
  failed run cost only their funding (no protocol meaning until stage 2's
  reference UTxO exists). `addresses.json` will be overwritten on the
  re-run; the old ref-script UTxOs become orphan.
- **Stake registration cert deposit refund.** If you ever needed to recover
  the ~2 ADA cert deposit, you'd have to deregister the credential.
  `mix_logic.publish` rejects deregistration (Rule 2 hyperstructure stance),
  so you're not getting that ADA back.
- **Mainnet.** None of these scripts default to mainnet. The bootstrap is
  one-shot per network; mainnet bootstrap is gated behind the audit per
  spec OQ-Y.

## Practice run

Before doing the canonical Preprod bootstrap, do at least one full run on a
private wallet and verify each artifact. The mint is one-shot per `(seed,
network)` — once you've spent the seed, you can't reuse it. On Preprod
that's fine (request more faucet ADA), but the practice helps you catch
parameter mismatches before the canonical run lands.
